My GMTK 2024 Game Jam Entry
===========================

This is my entry for the GMTK 2024 Game Jam. The theme is "Built to Scale".

This is an opensource game made with MonoDreams, a game engine I'm developing but this is still really reeeeally early stages.

The game is a 2D platformer inspired by Celeste where instead of dashes you can scale some platforms you touch.
